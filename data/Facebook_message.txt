"Donald J. Trump's ideas aren‚Äôt just different, they are dangerously incoherent. They‚Äôre not even really ideas‚Äîjust a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies. He is not just unprepared. He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability, and immense responsibility.

This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it‚Äôs not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump‚Äôs hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.

This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia. He believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008. He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists‚Äîeven though those are war crimes. He says he doesn‚Äôt have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has ‚Äúa very good brain.‚Äù He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends. He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia. And to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are a ‚Äúthird-world country.‚Äù And he‚Äôs been saying things like that for decades.

Those are the words of someone who doesn‚Äôt understand America or the world. And they‚Äôre the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction. Because if you really believe America is weak‚Äîwith our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching‚Äîthen you don‚Äôt know America. And you certainly don‚Äôt deserve to lead it."
"Weapons of war like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino have no place on our streets."
"We cannot demonize, demagogue, and declare war on an entire religion. That is dangerous and it plays into the hands of ISIS and other jihadist terrorists.

"\"Me uno a los estadounidenses en sus oraciones por las v√≠ctimas del ataque, por sus familias y los equipos de primera intervenci√≥n que hicieron todo lo posible para salvar vidas en Orlando. 

Esto fue un acto de terrorismo. Las autoridades y las organizaciones de inteligencia est√°n trabajando duro y vamos a saber m√°s en las pr√≥ximas horas y d√≠as. Por ahora, podemos decir de seguro que tenemos que redoblar nuestros esfuerzos para defender a nuestro pa√≠s de estas amenazas aqu√≠ y en el exterior. 

Eso quiere decir derrotar redes terroristas internacionales trabajando con aliados y colaboradores para enfrentarlos donde quiera que se encuentren, confrontando sus intentos de reclutar personas aqu√≠ y en todos lados, as√≠ como fortalecer nuestra defensa dom√©stica. Esto significa, adem√°s, rechazar el ser intimidado y permanecer fiel a nuestros valores.  

Esto tambi√©n fue un acto de odio. El pistolero atac√≥ una discoteca LGBT durante el mes de Orgullo Gay. Para todas las personas LGBT: sepan que tienen millones de aliados por todo el pa√≠s. Yo soy una de ellos. Continuaremos luchando por su derecho de vivir libre, abiertamente y sin miedo. El odio no tiene ning√∫n lugar en los Estados Unidos. 

Finalmente, tenemos que asegurar que las armas como las que fueron usadas anoche jam√°s caigan en las manos de terroristas y otros criminales violentos. Este es el tiroteo m√°s mort√≠fero en la historia de los Estados Unidos y nos vuelve a recordar que las armas de guerra no tienen lugar en nuestras calles. 

Este es un momento para unirnos y hacer todo lo que podamos para defender a nuestras comunidades y a nuestro pa√≠s\".‚ÄîHillary Clinton sobre el ataque terrorista en Orlando"
"I join Americans in praying for the victims of the attack in Orlando, their families and the first responders who did everything they could to save lives.  

This was an act of terror. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are hard at work, and we will learn more in the hours and days ahead. For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values.

This was also an act of hate. The gunman attacked an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them. We will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear. Hate has absolutely no place in America. 

Finally, we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.  

This is a time to stand together and resolve to do everything we can to defend our communities and country."

"Today's leaks prove that the so-called US-EU trade agreement has little to do with \"free trade\" and everything to do with increasing the power of Wall Street banks, pharmaceutical companies and big oil. Getting rid of regulations that protect workers and the environment may be good for corporate profits, but it would be a disaster for the American people. A trade agreement with Europe could give us an historic opportunity to improve the rights of workers, the environment, and consumer protections. Unfortunately, today's leaks show that this trade deal would do the exact opposite by continuing the race to the bottom. As president, Sen. Sanders will not agree to any trade deal that deregulates Wall Street, undermines American laws, increases the price of prescription drugs, threatens food safety and allows foreign corporations to challenge laws that would reduce their expected future profits before an international tribunal. Trade is a good thing, but it has got to be fair."
"\"You cannot exploit a broken campaign finance system one day and vow to get big money out of politics the next.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Weaver, Bernie 2016 campaign manager

‚ÄúSecretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways that let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Wal-Mart fame and the actor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits on campaign contributions. If Secretary Clinton can‚Äôt raise the funds needed to run in a competitive primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donald Trump in a general election?‚Äù"

The establishment wants us to believe that millions of people should continue going without any health insurance. We believe that if we stand together, all Americans can have health care as a right. 

The drug companies tell us that we cannot lower the outrageously high price of medicine. Together, that is exactly what we are gonna do. 

The fossil fuel industry tells us that we cannot move aggressively to combat climate change. but that is precisely what we will do. 

They told us our campaign was \"too radical,\" and that we were just a \"fringe campaign.\" Well we've won 21 contests so far, with a chance to win many of the upcoming states.

Let's keep standing up. Let's stick together. Let's win."
"All of this tells us why we need comprehensive immigration reform. I would hope that the Republicans in Congress understand that we have a very, very broken immigration system and that it must be reformed and that they should in fact work with Democrats to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

"DONALD J. TRUMP ON THE STAKES OF THE ELECTION

Today I‚Äòd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.

People have asked me why I am running for President.

I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.

We come to work together and turn visions into reality.

We think big, and then we make it happen.

I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.

So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.

When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton ‚Äì only by me.

The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!

Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can‚Äôt solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.

We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.

The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre asking Bernie Sanders‚Äô voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.

Because it‚Äôs not just the political system that‚Äôs rigged. It‚Äôs the whole economy.

It‚Äôs rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.

It‚Äôs rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.

It‚Äôs rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.

It‚Äôs rigged against you, the American people.

Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar ‚Äì

just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.[1]

Brian Williams‚Äô career was destroyed for saying far less.

Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.

I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.

We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.

This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.

Here is my promise to the American voter:

If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.

The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests ‚Äì and taking money from special interests.

Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.

She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund ‚Äì doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.

Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests ‚Äì in less than 2 years ‚Äì secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. [2] [3]

Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.[4]

They totally own her, and that will never change.

The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.

Those are the stakes.

Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.

She believes she is entitled to the office.

Her campaign slogan is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with her.‚Äù

You know what my response to that is? I‚Äôm with you: the American people.

She thinks it‚Äôs all about her.

I know it‚Äôs all about you ‚Äì I know it‚Äôs all about making America Great Again for All Americans.

Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.

We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism ‚Äì focusing on what‚Äôs good for America‚Äôs middle class ‚Äì to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.

We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.

This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.

This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.

We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.

That‚Äôs what we mean by America First.

Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.

Our Founders understood this.

One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for ‚Äúthe encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]‚Äù in America.[5]

Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:

‚ÄúThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.‚Äù[6]

I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton‚Äôs disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China‚Äôs entrance into the World Trade Organization.[7]

We‚Äôve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.[8]

Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.[9]

Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property ‚Äì a crime which is continuing to this day.[10]

Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.

In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!

The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America‚Äôs expense.

She gets rich making you poor.

Here is a quote from the book: ‚ÄúAt the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton‚Ä¶at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.‚Äù

These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.[11]

She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.

Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas ‚Äì and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.[12]

Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book ‚Äì deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)[13]

But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn‚Äôt change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career ‚Äì and it will be even worse than the Clintons‚Äô NAFTA deal.

I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.

We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.

It‚Äôs not just our economy that‚Äôs been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.

The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars ‚Äì and unleashed ISIS across the world.

No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.

Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.

Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.

Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.[14]

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department refused them all.

She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.

To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.[15]

Here is what one of the victim‚Äôs mothers had to say:

‚ÄúI want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don‚Äôt want this person to be president.‚Äù[16]

In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.

Libya was cooperating.

Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.

Syria was under control.

Iran was being choked by sanctions.

Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.

ISIS wasn‚Äôt even on the map.

Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed

to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.

Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.

Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen ‚Äì while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.[17]

She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora‚Äôs box of radical Islam.

Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.[18]

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.

ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality ‚Äì and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.

In short, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.

It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.[19]

Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.[20]

But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn‚Äôt wait to rush us off to war in Libya.

She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.

In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:

‚ÄúShe simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve

in the office‚Ä¶from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true‚Ä¶Her leadership style ‚Äì volcanic, impulsive‚Ä¶disdainful of the rules set for everyone else ‚Äì hasn‚Äôt changed a bit.‚Äù[21]

Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.

In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.[22]

Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth ‚Äì with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.[23] [24]

Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[25]

The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.[26]

I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.

Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.

Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.[27]

Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.

Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:

A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.[28]
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America‚Äôs uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.[29]
Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access ‚Äì even though he had no national security credentials.[30]
Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State ‚Äì plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary‚Äôs Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. [31]
Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.[32]
Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.[33]
To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.

Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments ‚Äì perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China ‚Äì putting all of America in danger.[34]

Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.[35]

While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.

So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.

This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.

We can‚Äôt hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.

National security is also immigration security ‚Äì and Hillary wants neither.

Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.

She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.[36]

The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.

Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.

She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.[37]

Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.

Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza‚Äôs letter:

‚ÄúHillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms‚Äô way ‚Äì an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.‚Äù

Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.

For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.

Hillary‚Äôs Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can‚Äôt claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.

Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:

Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.
Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs
Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many
Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas
Lift restrictions on energy production
Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.
Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.
Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.
There is one common theme in all of these reforms.

It‚Äôs going to be America First.

This is why the stakes in November are so great.

On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.

The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don‚Äôt need or want another Clinton or Obama.

Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.

They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs message is old and tired. Her message is that can‚Äôt change.

My message is that things have to change ‚Äì and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.

Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.

Then we started thinking small.

We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.

We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.

But that‚Äôs not who we are.

Come this November, we can bring America back ‚Äì bigger and better, and stronger than ever.

We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth ‚Äì the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.

Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment ‚Äì we will bring it back all the way.

Massive new factories will come roaring into our country ‚Äì breathing life and hope into our communities.

Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.

Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.

The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary‚Äôs massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.

We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.

I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.

Our country is going to start working again.

People are going to start working again.

Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again ‚Äì including parents in our inner cities.

Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.

We are going to make America rich again.

We are going to make America safe again.

We are going to make America Great Again ‚Äì and Great Again For EVERYONE.

DONALD J. TRUMP ENDORSED BY NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
 
Mr. Trump Receives Coveted Endorsement Days Before Super Tuesday

(New York, NY) February 26th, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump received the coveted endorsement of highly respected New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at a campaign rally in Fort Worth, TX. The endorsement comes one day after the latest Republican debate and just days before the votes are cast in the Super Tuesday primary contest. 

Mr. Trump stated, ‚ÄúIt is my great honor to receive the endorsement of the Governor. We have had a wonderful relationship for many years. He is a solid person that I have tremendous respect for. I am really proud to receive the support of the Governor and his family.‚Äù 

Governor Christie, who ended his Presidential bid earlier this month following the New Hampshire primary added, ‚ÄúDonald is a leader. He is a successful person that, like me, isn‚Äôt afraid to tell it like it is. Our system is broken and it won‚Äôt be fixed from the inside. I am proud to offer my endorsement of his candidacy for President.‚Äù 

Governor Christie joined Mr. Trump at a campaign event in Texas to officially announce the endorsement and will travel with him to Oklahoma City for a rally later today. 

Mr. Trump has also been endorsed by Congressmen Chris Collins, Congressman Duncan Hunter, Jr., former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, South Carolina Lt. Governor Henry McMaster, Arizona Treasurer Jeff DeWitt and many other influential conservative leaders. He will campaign in Oklahoma later today and travel to Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia and beyond over the next few days."

"DONALD J. TRUMP ADDRESSES TERRORISM, IMMIGRATION, AND NATIONAL SECURITY

Thank you for joining me today.

This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.

Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.

There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.

But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.

The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country‚Äôs history.

So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.

The horror is beyond description.

The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.

We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.

We mourn, as one people, for our nation‚Äôs loss ‚Äì and pledge our support to any and all who need it.

I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.

Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.

This is a very dark moment in America‚Äôs history.

A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.

It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.

It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.

It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.

We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people ‚Äì with force, purpose and determination.

But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.

If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart ‚Äì and fast ‚Äì we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.

The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don‚Äôt share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.

The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.

That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.

We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.

We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.

With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.

I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.

The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.

I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.

After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.

We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.

Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.

Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.

I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.

It‚Äôs not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.

If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans ‚Äì women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people ‚Äì then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.

We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.

We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.

Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.

All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.

Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.

The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.

The male shooter in San Bernardino ‚Äì again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife ‚Äì the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.

Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.

We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.

If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.

Yet, Hillary Clinton ‚Äì for months and despite so many attacks ‚Äì repeatedly refused to even say the words ‚Äúradical Islam,‚Äù until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.

However, Hillary Clinton ‚Äì who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage ‚Äì still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won‚Äôt speak honestly about what it is.

She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.

In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: ‚ÄúMuslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.‚Äù

Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans‚Äô guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.

I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.

The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.

In fact, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.

When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss ‚Äì it's deadly.

The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.

I refuse to be politically correct.

I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.

The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.

As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.

We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials ‚Äì and with our allies.

I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism ‚Äì and who will have the support they require to get the job done.

We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.

The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.

Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.

These Departments refused to comply.

President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.

The public has a right to know how these people got here.

We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.

We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.

Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?

Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.

Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.

In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.

Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.

This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.

We can't let this happen.

Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.

The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.

The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.

The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.

Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?

We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States ‚Äì we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.

What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.

That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.

We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.

The media talks about ‚Äúhomegrown,‚Äù terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.

Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don‚Äôt keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.

For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.

This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?

Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn‚Äôt share their views.

She can‚Äôt have it both ways. She can‚Äôt claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.

How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?

Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here‚Äîin vast numbers‚Äîwho reject our values?

Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country‚Äîthey enslave women, and murder gays.

I don‚Äôt want them in our country.

Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn‚Äôt support our communities ‚Äì all of our communities.

America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.

Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven‚Äôt budged in many years.

So whether it‚Äôs matter of national security, or financial security, we can‚Äôt afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.

All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.

I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad ‚Äì and they do know where they are.

I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.

I want to protect our citizens ‚Äì all of our citizens.

The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.

In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.

We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.

We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.

We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.

We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan ‚Äì including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us ‚Äì is brought to justice.

If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .

America must do more ‚Äì much more ‚Äì to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.

It also means we must change our foreign policy.

The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.

These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.

That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.

For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.

I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.

America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.

We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.

I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.

When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.

America will be a tolerant and open society.

America will also be a safe society.

We will protect our borders at home.

We will defeat ISIS overseas.

We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.

We will make America rich again.

We will make America safe again.

We will make American Great Again.

Thank you."
