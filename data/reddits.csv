carson,Considering it's against federal law why isn't anyone suing trump or carson over this?
carson,"At least two strikes against him. 1. Trump said he wants a vice president that would be able to be a good president.  2. Trump wants someone who is a savvy politician (""someone political"")."
carson,3 -  Trump wants someone who is not a religious nut bag like Steve Harvey
carson,Um... so when is that war going to start? 
carson,Not confusing.  He was always a dolt.
carson,"I don't know you, but chances are you know BEN CARSON. And chances are you know how inspirational his story is. It is so relatable to old, young, poor, rich, educated, uneducated, etc and inspiring to all. 
Even if Ben Carson does not win the Presidency, there are chances he will become General Surgeon or play a role in guiding healthcare in America (he was helping bush implement healthcare reform until 9/11 ruined the plans/funding). 
Thanks for inspiring millions of Americans to help heal this country Dr. Ben Carson. God bless. "

carson,"I don't get it, why did they stay off to the side? What was that supposed to mean? and why the hell did the announcers ""forget"" the Ohio Gov.?"
carson,"Carson and Trump say they didn't hear their names, apparently, even though every other candidate knew to come out when their name was called. It seems that these two must've thought they were lined up in the incorrect order, or that the announcers called them in the wrong order. In any case, the candidates made the mistakes, not the announcers.

And they didn't forget Kasich - they do call him, but by then the audience is too rowdy and Trump and Carson are confusing everyone, including the stagehand."
carson,"The woman wasn't as loud as the man, so trump and ben didn't hear.  I personally didn't hear trump the second time I watched the video."
carson,"They said ""ladies and gentlemen, the republican candidates."" And then afterward call out the gov. as in he was an afterthought himself."
carson,"Watch it again, and listen at 1:33, right after Bush goes through."
carson,F
carson,"this is the funniest shit I've seen in a long time, I applaud the Bernie camp for making the effort but you do realize the two candidates have practically nothing in common right? Although they both did speak about economic inequality there couldn't be a more diametrically opposed set of positions than Carson and Sanders on how to fix it."
carson,No
carson,No
carson,">Loosers

Loosers? So they aren't tight?
