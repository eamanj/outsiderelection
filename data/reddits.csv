sanders,Oh. Neat.
sanders,"One time my neighbor called me at like 2 in the morning because she thought someone was trying to break into her house and her alcoholic husband hadn't come home yet. I went over the inspect the situation and found her husband sitting in a tree in the backyard with a shotgun and a six pack. I asked him what he was doing and he said ""I'm having a beer"".

Oh. Neat."
sanders,"So, no poetry then?"
sanders,"That is more than neat. That is incredible. 

The guy is making an effort to understand the depths of who he is. Imagine putting a man with a soul in the White House. Nothing against Obama/every other president we've ever had, but those men are machines. They are communication machines, trained to appear however they need to appear. For some reason America has placed a very surface-level value on our leaders. We don't really care about who they are as people. That, to me, is frightening. These are the most powerful men in the world, after all. Are we really content to leave the world's fate up to a puppet? 

I'd rather have a clumsy, awkward-looking, tongue-tied man who is genuinely, honestly passionate about saving the world, fighting corruption, etc.; than a beautiful robot who has lost his integrity getting elected. 

I am reminded of a quote from Douglass Adams: 

""Anyone capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job.""

I really think/hope that's about to change. A successful grassroots movement via modern technology (i.e. reddit) that allows for free, no-strings-attached global advertising could truly revolutionize how our nation handles politics. 

Here's to the future, ladies and gentlemen. "
sanders,">Imagine putting a man with a soul in the White House. 

You mean like Jimmy Carter?"
sanders,"Yep. Too bad the poor guy got thrashed by the media every time he took a step...

It's almost as if someone paid a lot of money to teach the American people that a good heart makes for an incompetent leader."
sanders,"I raise my glass to the future. The tide is changing in this country and with Mr. Sanders in the office, it could only be for the better. The GOP is in the death throes of an aging political ""party"" filled with people who have disdain for anyone unlike them and who are ruining this country slowly but surely from the inside. The once well-meaning Republican party is now rotten to its very core. I cannot fathom why anyone would follow the GOP unless they are mega-rich or actively hate women, minorities or non-heteros.

We need a man with heart who truly cares about the American people. He has been an advocate for civil rights since the 1960s and hasn't stopped since. I have been following his career ever since I started to become politically aware in high school and I am SO DAMN THRILLED he is running for President. WE NEED HIM. I'm registered Green but will reg. Democrat to vote for him in the Primaries. YOU FUCKING GO, UNCLE BERNIE.

SANDERS 2016. "
sanders,"Yes, I have been more to the right with presidential elections lately, but Sanders is a dem I can really get behind. I haven't disagreed with a thing he's said"
sanders,Hillary gon be piiiiiiiiissed.
sanders,"Hello!

Having you elected President seems to be the best possible thing that can happen to America at this point. I posted the comment below in a thread a few days ago when someone asked why they should vote for you:

""I'll give you three very good reasons:

One: [Bernie Sander's top campaign contributors](http://i.imgur.com/GCOVi0J.png)

Two: [Legislative history](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357)

Three: [Powerful speech backed by said history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsDYAtKlsT4) "" 

I was planning on just recycling this comment for any thread where it seemed relevant, as I can't think of a much more convincing argument in my own words. Is there anything you would include aside from the three links listed to adequately represent who you are as a person and politician? 

Edit: [Site containing the images in the first link](https://www.opensecrets.org)

"
sanders,"> Having you elected President seems to be the best possible thing that can happen to America at this point.

It makes me kind of sad that I keep seeing this sentiment. Do Americans not realize how much their politics affect the world? The amount of influence the USA has over world politics is pretty insane. As a Canadian, who feels his government is heavily influenced by yours, I'm desperate to see Bernie Sanders elected president. 

So just keep that in mind guys, it probably means much more than you all realize to a lot of people outside America too."
sanders,"You know reddit and crowd funding could accomplish some great things, but I think we've been setting our sights too low. Fuck new electronics devices, or even all your new startups, or whatever. That's great, but let's set our sights higher. The implications of this would be enormous - we have the potential to destabilize the entire news and political industries in this country by crowd funding the god damn President of the United States. If Bernie Sanders gets elected, in 50 years there will be pHD theses about the rise of the internet as a real force for social change and collective action. 

This is the face of new capitalism and democracy - do not miss your chance to be part of it."

#Ladies and gentlemen, [it's time!!!!!!](https://gfycat.com/ScornfulFlashyArctichare) 

We've been working for a over a year (since December, 2013 to be precise) to build up a large, informative, and supportive knowledge-base for all things pertaining to Senator Sanders. We want him in the White House, and if you're reading this and you have ANY interest in learning more about him, his voting history, and the beliefs he stands for, please pay us a visit! I'm attaching several resources to this comment as well - just keep reading.

If you want to chip in and help the cause, go ahead and subscribe to the subreddit. Participate as often as possible. Visit multiple times a day, read the comments, and **learn all that you can.** Spread the word far and wide! Bernie DOES have a chance. It's defeatist and flat-out wrong to say anything otherwise - you're just creating a self-fulfilling prophecy if you speak that way. He's honest, authentic, and one of the only people out there standing up for the common men and women of America. But even though it's going to take a lot of work to triumph over Hillary and her endless pockets of Wall Street money, we can still do it.

Look at it this way. There is ZERO risk in voting for him in the Primary, because if he earns the Democratic nomination, GREAT! He'll have a great chance at beating the ""best"" Republican candidate. And if he loses to Hillary, that's too bad, but you can still always just vote for her if you *really* don't want a Republican in the White House. But he won't be a spoiler. He won't cause a Nader Effect. And if you disregard all the stigma and misinformation, and just let his policies and 35 year history do the talking, the choice is obvious. He needs to be the next President of the United States of America. And he can be. 

* [Link to his official campaign website](https://www.berniesanders.com)  
* [Link to his OnTheIssues.org page](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/bernie_sanders.htm#). Don't let people spread misinformation! Learn as much as you can about Senator Sanders and spread the knowledge far and wide. His opponents will make up whatever kind of baseless, slanderous nonsense possible to derail him and his message. The best way to defend against that is to PROVE them wrong, with citations and facts.  
* [Link to his official 12-step platform](https://berniesanders.com/issues/)  
* [Link to register as a volunteer](https://berniesanders.com/volunteer/)  
* [Link to donate directly to his campaign -- DO NOT DONATE TO ANY OTHER SOURCES UNTIL THEY ARE VERIFIED BY BERNIE'S OFFICE THEMSELVES](https://berniesanders.com/donate/)
* [Link to our ""Reddit Campaign,"" where we will be offering additional information and instruction on how you can help out](https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/31by9a/the_reddit_campaign_for_sanders_2016/)

And before anyone asks - No. I do not work for Senator Sanders or his campaign. I am just a regular person like you that has decided it's time to try and fight for the things I believe in. You can too. Let's get to work.

Oh. And one more thing......

Everyone, remember you HAVE to vote twice in 2016 if you want Bernie Sanders in the White House! 1) Your State's Democratic Party Primary. 2) November 8, 2016.   
We've never needed such a huge push to get voters to turn out for the primaries before. It won't be nearly as easy for Bernie Sanders to take Hillary Clinton out as it was for the considerably more moderate Barack Obama in 2008.  
**[2016 Democratic Primary Election Schedule - ALL STATES - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016#Schedule_of_primaries_and_caucuses)**  
  
And don't downvote Bernie Sanders links just because you're tired of seeing them, or think they're reposts. This one has to spread like no campaign we've ever witnessed. We're fighting 2 men with an $889,000,000 check on the Republican side, and Goldman Sachs and most of Wall Street on the Hillary side. At $5-$50 per donation, Bernie needs A LOT of us. "
sanders,"I'm not registered as a Democrat, and I'm in NY State. But it's important to me that Bernie gets the nomination. What do I do?"

sanders,"I don't know, there's always a catch, though. We're not voting for anyone right now, so I guess there's plenty of time to see where he goes with this."
sanders,"The catch is ""they"" don't want him to win.

The catch is if you want this to happen, you actually have to work for it."
sanders,The catch is the democratic party will almost certainly still choose Hillary as their candidate because she'll maintain the status quo.
sanders,He won't have a billion dollars backing him.
sanders,The catch is that all the super wealthy who profit from the current corrupt state of affairs in this country will be pressuring the media to dismiss his campaign from day one.  Get ready for *a lot* of dismissive talking heads in the next few months.
sanders,"The pressure will come on all sides. We're not fighting Hilary; or the GOP, we're fighting the entrenched hegemony of America."
sanders,"Well, there's that old Bill Hicks joke about what happens after you get elected..."
sanders,"""""I have this feeling that whoever's elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what promises you make on the campaign trail - blah, blah, blah - when you win, you go into this smoky room with the twelve industrialist, capitalist scum that got you in there, and this little screen comes down... and it's a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you've never seen before, which looks suspiciously off the grassy knoll.... And then the screen comes up, the lights come on, and they say to the new president, 'Any questions?'

'Just what my agenda is.'

-Bill Hicks.

"
sanders,"""Any questions?"""
sanders,"The catch is he calls himself a socialist and that will alienate moderate conservatives.

EDIT: Also he'll be 6 years older than the oldest president at inauguration at a time when youth counts for more than it ever did. Just like when Ron Paul ran, he'll be marginalized by moderates as the crazy old man."
sanders,Wasn't there a poll showing a majority of youth in America were socialist leaning?
sanders,and that kids don't vote.
sanders,They did for Obama. And Sanders has an actual record to back him up.
sanders,"I don't disagree with you at all. In a way, Obamas lack of a record was actually of benefit. They had nothing on the guy. I wonder what Sanders naysayers will have on him? Socialist leanings maybe?"
sanders,He just won't get any press because the press won't put him on because their owners don't want us to know that we have a choice.
sanders,"yeah, but kids grow up. Obama was elected 7 years ago, those kids are now in their late 20s and 30s. They lean socially left and showed up. "
sanders,"And hopefully, now that those kids that voted for Obama are buying houses, getting salaried jobs, dealing with hardships in life, hopefully they've realize that there IS a reason to vote, and that if you don't, we could be in a world of hurt."
sanders,The catch is that this won't be an easy victory and we are gonna have to work hard as voters if we want him to win.
sanders,"Well, he has my vote. So that's 1."
sanders,He has my 2 votes.... My cat turned 18 last year so i registered her

sanders,"I'm young - the first presidential election I was able to vote in was in 2008 - but I've been paying attention to politics since about 2001. In that short time, I've grown extremely disenchanted with United States politics. The inherent greed, the unofficial oligarchy, the obsession over secrecy, the steadily creeping infringements upon the rights that have so long defined us as Americans. It's incredibly hard to be optimistic in this environment.

You, Senator Sanders, you give me hope. You seem to be one of the tiny minority of pols out there who is actually trying to help people, rather than enrich him/herself. You speak your mind plainly and honestly, a quality which so many others desperately need, and lack. I consider myself an independent, but I registered with my state's Democratic party this morning so I can vote for you in the primary. I'm also contributing to your campaign - something I've never, ever done before. GIVE EM HELL BERNIE!

Even if you don't win, you have enough support to put your campaign in the national spotlight, and get people talking about the most dire threat to our republic: the ever-increasing influence of money in our government. You have the ability to get people asking themselves whether or not they really want to live in an oligarchy. That is incredibly valuable in itself. Bernie 2016!!"
sanders,"I feel kind of dirty changing my registration from Independent to Democrat; but if I must, I must."
sanders,I'm going from Green to Democrat to vote for Bernie. We gotta do what we gotta do.
sanders,I feel the same way about changing mine from Green to Democrat. But it's worth it. 
sanders,I gotta change mine from republican.
sanders,"Yeah same here. I'm 45 and this is the first time I'll be registering with a party affiliation. Ah well, I can change it back after the primary. 
"
sanders,I just did the same thing and felt a bit dirty as well.
sanders,"Hey, Bernie did it too, so there's that. I'm sure he had to hold his nose.

Edit: autocrekt."

sanders,"Hi there, you have my full support and I'll do everything I can to get you elected. But I have a very serious question for you. Would you be willing to put some of your goals on wedge issues aside in order to bring people who tend to be socially conservative, but who would vote for you based on your fight to return America to a more fiscally equitable society? 

For example, gun rights. I agree that its a huge issue, but there are many people in my area that won't vote for ANYONE that they think might restrict their right to own guns, no matter where the candidate stands on more pressing issues. 

If I'm going to be able to sway people in my area to vote for you , and I think I can...we'd have to remove those kinds of distractions. 

Does that make sense?

>He **also voted against the landmark Brady Bill**, which instituted federal background checks on firearms purchases. In his book, Outsider in the House, Sanders wrote **he opposed the bill because he felt handgun waiting periods could be dealt with at the state level.**

If you can donate, do it (https://berniesanders.com). We're going up against the billionaire elite who have no problems co-opting media to get their message across, we need to do the same. Bernie is incredibly passionate, credibly informed, and not afraid to stand up to Wall Street and the billionaire class. We need to be the same. "

sanders,"Senator Sanders, I want to take a quick moment to personally thank you for giving myself and millions of other Americans a reason to get finally excited for politics on the national level.  No longer do I feel apathetic about the upcoming elections.  No longer do I feel like I need to vote for the ""lesser of two evils"".

Would you, if president, push for capacity or capability limits, or for bans of any currently legal weapon or accessory, or force owners to go through more hoops to legally obtain an accessory or firearm?
 
On the flip side of this, would you limit the police forces of this nation from becoming an oppressive military force? Will you strip them of the tanks and armored vehicles, automatic weapons and explosive devices, expect for what is explicitly required for small squads like SWAT and HRT?

No republican could have won against Obama. Maybe, if Chris Christie had run he could have won, but he decided to not run and lost his opportunity forever. Gingrich is a true conservative, but the guy had no charisma and he had a long history of sexcapades that would appear in the general election. It is very funny to remember that our ""best candidate"" in 2012 was the guy who created Romneycare, so he couldn´t criticize Obamacare."

Again, I can't emphasize enough how much your support has meant to me against these politics of hate and bigotry. I'm confident you will keep America on the right track. I personally can't wait to fight for you in the coming months and to promote your message.

On a side note, this is just incredibly cool"
clinton,"It means so much to me that you took time out of your busy schedule (seriously, when do you sleep?) to acknowledge us. Thank you for all that you do, and thanks to all 6k+ subscribers for making this subreddit the wonderful place that it is. You have been a role model for me since I was a young girl, and I have only grown to love you more as I have gotten older. I caucused for you in 2008, and I can't wait to cast my vote for you in November. It's going to be an amazing sight to behold when you finally shatter that glass ceiling, and I should probably start stocking up on tissues now. We're all with you.

Thank you for stopping by our subreddit!

I have a daughter. And while I have a million other reasons to vote for you, it *is* important to me that she can see that not only can a woman run for President, but a woman **IS** the President. What a world where she can grow up and see a woman be President.

You are an inspiration to me and you will be an inspiration to my daughter, and now she’s going to grow up **knowing** she can become president, because you have blazed the trail already. 

We’re with you and seriously, kick some ass out there."

I was so in awe of this man and this woman standing next to him and from that day on I needed to know everything about you and Bill. You were my Senator from New York, I supported you and 2008 and you are my hero. I just want to say that from the bottom of my heart I can't wait for you to be our next president. I got your back 100%. thank you thank you thank you for being such an amazing woman and person and public figure. I am just incredibly grateful for all of the things you do for the country and for women everywhere. "

You have been working hard for us for decades and I know you will keep that fight going.

Lastly, it means a lot that you popped in here. You are right---Reddit is a tough place to be a Hillary Clinton supporter. But the mods have done an amazing job of keeping this a positive space for us to share in our enthusiasm for you."

Thank you for your acknowledgement of us. The mods here are wonderful and extremely dedicated. I found this sub as a refuge, but it has become something more to me due to their enthusiasm and perseverance. Through their encouragement, I have become a much more committed and active participant in the effort to make you the first woman President of the United States.

I am a huge fan of yours and an absolute fan of everything you do especially for women's rights and minority rights.

I am trying to do what I can to support your barrier breaking candidacy. I hope we will have a much needed return to good, smart government in 2017!"
clinton,"Madam Secretary,

Thank you. Thank you for your courage, your wit, your intelligence, and your history of advocating for the voiceless in this country. As a girl in the 90s, it meant a lot to me that our First Lady was such a strong-minded and intelligent woman, with a career and passions of her own, and as I grew up, your time in the Senate and your tenure as Secretary of State set another incredible example of what women can do. And now, I can't wait to vote for you in the fall, and prove that when it comes to the highest political office in the land, women are absolutely just as capable as men. "

There is no doubt in my mind you'll hit the ground running your first day in office. Thank you for acknowledging this community. Yes there has been some hostile comments, but I think because of many of the people this subreddit who will engage haters in r/politics, reason is making a comeback. It's easy for me to defend Hillary because I know she's a great candidate."

clinton,"Hello, Madame Secretary.
I'm an 18 year old student at Boise High School, in Boise Idaho. I am huge fan of your politics, and your views, especially on the LGBTQIA+ issues. As a transgendered teen, it makes me happy that you are so open minded about these issues in America. I just have a question for you, what policies would you be willing to advocate for on the social treatment and/or safety of transgendered and lgbtqia+ persons? Thank you very much!"
clinton,"Hello Secretary (and hopefully President) Clinton! What an honor to have you here!

As a millennial guy now out in the working world (and yes, a 2008 Obama supporter... At first glance you would swear I must be a Sanders supporter!) I have always been passionate about voting in every election I can, but never have I been this excited about the prospects of having a candidate with such experience, knowledge, and dedication to all of the issues facing the country and compassion for all the people of the country. America will be incredibly fortunate to have someone with your pragmatism and abilities steering the ship, and progressives are incredibly fortunate to have such a powerful ally and resilient fighter. Very proud to have early-voted for you here in Illinois and to have made my first-ever political contribution to your campaign!

Best of luck to you tonight at the debate and in the coming weeks' elections!

I am so proud to support you during the campaign. I met you at the fundraiser at the Parker Meridian where I was volunteering and got to hear you speak then (and get an awesome selfie!). I also had so much fun at the #ImWithHer concert this week! I think you are the best and most qualified person ever to run for president, and hope that come January you become the 45th.

I cannot wait to put the final crack in that highest, hardest glass ceiling."
clinton,">*especially here* 

For. Real.

I hope you come back and read these comments after tonight's debate.

My first memory of being exposed to public policy was while you were FLOTUS.  I had some project assignment in grade school to write a paper on any current event (the details escape me).  I chose to research and write on your healthcare platform.  My mother wasn't too thrilled with your husband's administration, and I tried to talk me into writing about something else.  Me, being a stubborn brat, stuck with my choice and the more I read about you and your values and priorities, the more I grew to respect you. Now I'm a policy researcher in DC and can't help but thank you for ""cracking that glass ceiling"" and pushing the world to accept the fact that women deserve a national public policy voice.  You truly are an inspiration.

Thank you for stopping by!  I'm with YOU! "

clinton,"Ahhh! 

I've considered you a role model for such a long time, Secretary Clinton, and I'm so proud that I got to vote for you in my first ever primary! Along with President Obama, I have looked up to you and admired your knowledge, toughness, and heart for service for years, and in fact you are one of my biggest inspirations as I go to law school in DC in the fall and (hopefully) pursue a career in politics! 

I'm so happy to get to do what I can for your campaign! You are truly an inspiration to women everywhere, and I can't wait to watch your inauguration in January!  "

clinton,Lame fangirling over here. I'm in tears. OMG. 
clinton,"Madam Secretary, I know you're busy, and that you probably won't be able to read all of these. 

Things are very hard for a lot of us right now. I'm in the demographic that's supposed to be voting for Bernie. I'm white and working class. I live in Washington DC. I've been unemployed, underemployed, or self employed since I left college. I'm supposed to have a degree, but can't afford to pay my school the money it needs in order to issue me that degree. There are student loans I can't pay in addition to that. It's very hard for me to have much hope for the future, considering the direction in which things have been going. That things are looking up for some is nice, but it's very hard for many of us to feel that.

I'm supporting you because the policies you've set out, and the statements you've made, make me think that you will be the hardest fighter for people like me. I've even [blogged about it](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/01/28/1472886/-As-an-Occupy-Wall-Street-Democrat-I-support-Hillary-She-s-strongest-by-far-on-Wall-Street-reform), and then was personally and viciously attacked by people I considered allies, some of whom attempted to discount all of the work I've tried to do as an activist and a Democrat.

While I have certain expectations, I don't expect you to win every fight. But I do expect you to come back swinging every time. Because that's your record. You lost on Hillarycare, and you came back swinging. You've come back swinging no matter what people put you through. The BS you've had to put up with! Cookies, for example. 

I've watched the nonsense you've been through, and though there are places we disagree, I think you're exactly the fighter we need, as well as the **strategist** we need.

I'm with you. So are a lot of other Millennials. And a lot of us are tired of people asking nonsense questions about why we, your Millennial supporters, don't exist. 

Fight for us, Madam Secretary. Help us build a country where we can feel hopeful about the future. 

Fight for us, and we'll fight for you."
clinton,Looking forward to you becoming our President :)
clinton,Girl - you are braver than I thought. Go Madame President out into the thicket of prickly ignorance. I bow to your balls of steel. And I will vote for you.

trump,"Am I the only one that kinda likes Jeb! a bit though? like I just want to give him a hug and tell him it's okay. Like, he knew he would never be president but his family was like your a bush son. And he kinda did it,even tho he didn't want to. "
trump,His entire family's background revolves around war profiteering. Fuck em all
trump,"I feel bad for him on and off. Every time I do, I remember that triumphant smile he had when all those paid RNC shills at the NH debate cheered loudly for him and booed the hell out of Trump. Then my heart hardens."
trump,"Yeah, I think Jeb is okay. I was actually glad when I heard he was running, since he himself must have known that his association with his brother would make it an uphill battle in places. The republican establishment likely thought so too, which is why Jeb went into the primaries without their backing, them having thrown their weight behind Rubio instead.

Jeb may be a low energy, foolish guac bowl merchant, but Cruz is a lying canadian sleazebag, Rubio is literally just a puppet for the RNC, and I only wish that Kasich and the Sleepy Doctor were high-profile enough for me to have formed an actual opinion of them."
trump,"As a person? He seems like a likable enough guy. I'd make small talk with him at a barbecue.

As a presidential contender with serious monetary backing? Fuck em. As the Guac Merchant himself said, ""Running for president is a tough business."""
trump,"It's not like it's different from any other year, it's just this year he KNOWS he's low energy."
trump,He always knew. Now everybody else does too. 
trump,He is still winning life pretty hard. 
trump,Being married to a goblin and having a mess of kids that look nothing like while your daughter has a drug addiction. Sounds like losing to me no matter how much money and influence you may have.
trump,"And he has, demonstrably, negative influence."
trump,Not nimble at all. 
trump,"Every year they would tease him for never being a President, and every year Jeb would say, ""I could be President if I want to!""  Now that he finally tried and failed, Jeb will be forever sulking in shame."
trump,"""Yeah, well if you and dad hadn't fucked that up for me I might've had a chance!"" Says the cornered Jeb"
trump,"Well at least one thing is certain, the Bush punch bowl is going to be twice as large, and be gone three times as fast. Turtles can get real thirsty."
trump,They will all be held in disgrace
trump,The guac bowl on the other hand
trump,I'm imagining him sulking over a gallon of guac in his pjs and a snuggie late at night on the couch crying while spooning it into his face watching 'The American President'.
trump,Just let Jeb play with his turtles and leave him alone!!
trump,Leave Jeb alone! Leave Jeb alone I'm SERIOUS!
trump,"Where did the turtle meme come from, just jeb!'s super hunched shoulders? "
trump,"Hijacking. Where did the ""guac merchant"" thing come from?"
trump,"He sold ""guacamole bowls"" on his website in a shameless bid for the hispanic vote."
trump,"He sold $75 plastic guac bowls to help fund his campaign. If you hurry you can still buy one:

trump,"> Jeb and Columba love whipping up guacamole on **Sunday Funday.** 

I mean fuck... you really can't make this shit up."
trump,"He's literally Cyril from Archer. 

""Stir Friday?"""
trump,He literally carries small toy turtles in his pockets and gives them to kids
trump,"Wait what? As in, to signify that he was a ""turtle"" and would eventually win despite the polls? Please tell me he didn't indirectly describe himself as a turtle. What the fuck is wrong with this guy this is so embarrassing..."
trump,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O74XDI-o7xc&t=0m44s

Just listen to the reporter: ""Are you serious?"" Just no one respects him anymore."
trump,"Lol, I love how the uploader used the theme from Lost for when someone is dying."
trump,Hahahah wow. Genius. 
trump,That entire video was golden. God damn I'm crying 
trump,"I'm so embarrassed for him, my pity/cringe overwhelms my dislike for the Bush dynasty and the fact his whole campaign was hilarious in its failure"
trump,"Trump is literally the [political equivalent of an Alpha Chad Thundercock.](http://i.imgur.com/apPwJzn.jpg)

Jeb is literally the [autistic beta from r9k that Chad picks on.](http://i.imgur.com/tpyegC7.gif)"
trump,This is...AMAZING!
trump,"His neck skin, oh my god. 

It's so... so.... TURTLE-Y. "
trump,Would make a fine purse. 
trump,"I never realized how much more Jeb looks like a Bush without his glasses. That gif is the first time I've seen him where his physical appearance significantly reminds me of his brother and dad.

Yeah, yeah, he's still wearing his glasses, but they're just not as pronounced from that angle "
trump,"http://i.imgur.com/MqSxHdW.png
"
trump,I don't get why that's so funny. It's really sweet.
trump,"The one with GOP royalty roots spanning generations, the man on who hundreds of millions in campaign funding would be spend on, the GOP establishment heir apparent and most heavily pushed by the powers that be on the right has been reduced to a guac bowl merchant meme by Donald.

[You just cannot make this shit up.](http://i.imgur.com/kAeZmdt.jpg)"
trump,Is that Rand Paul smiling in the background?
trump,MIGHT AS WELL BE
trump,It's Jeb! Not Jeb.
trump,"I feel so bad for Jeb, its like we're making fun of that slow kid in the class."
trump,No we are making fun of the band nerd that makes fun of everyone else for not being in band. # lowenergybeta.
trump,I dont feel bad at all for him. The asshole spent millions on behalf of establishment to derail Trump train. He intentionally kept getting under Trump's skin during debates in front of RNC stacked audience. He can fuck off to being nobody with his Millions while Trump takes care of us middle class Americans. 
trump,"Remember when he was the ""smart son"" and the ""policy wonk""?  

He actually, somehow, made Dubya look talented."
trump,Jeb gave us something to contrast with Dubya.  He proved pretty convincingly that money and connections aren't everything in politics.
trump,Also the kid that promises pizza for lunch every day.
trump,He did spend the most money per vote on pizza. 
trump,Bernie? Good ol Proletariat Pie.
trump,"Nah, bernies the kid that promises no homework and double summer"
trump,"You mean every student council election ever? It's almost as if running under the ""free shit"" platform is juvenile."
trump,Dude was born a millionaire and to one of the most powerful families in the world. He'll be fine. 
trump,http://i.imgur.com/34AYLNJ.jpg
trump,How'd you make this image? I really want one without the background words or maybe with different words.
trump,"I didn't make it, but you could easily make it in Photoshop."

trump,Then make one. Industriousness built America! Help make it great again!

trump,/u/CaptainDogeSparrow is a mess
trump,"/u/CaptainDogeSparrow is a waste

"
trump,/u/CaptainDogeSparrow is a big fat mistake. 
trump,Even though he's part of a shitty family and he bashed on Donald I feel bad for the guy. He seems like he'd be a nice dude outside of politics.
trump,And he'd be a terrible neocon *in* politics. 
trump,"I know his brother's presidency was a disaster and all, but I really wouldn't criticize his family. His father was a great American who served this country perhaps better than anyone. Give credit where it's due. "
trump,"They all seem like genuinely nice people. Terrible politicians, but the kind of people you wouldn't mind being neighbors with."
trump,His father should have beat Clinton. Perot stealing votes handed the election to Clinton.
trump,">threw his genes down the genetic shredder
Have you not seen his wife? "
trump,"Perhaps I painted that picture too broadly, you're correct. ""W"" fucked up their family name so heavily that it's hard to remember that their 1 term father was a ~~decent~~ great public servant.


EDIT: The shills are brigade down voting all comments on here. "
trump,"I think George W. and yes even Cheney care deeply about this country. But then 9/11 happened which was a huge fuck. I mean, you're the most powerful person in the world and 9/11 happens, what are you supposed to do? You can't do nothing. "
trump,"He was a great leader AFTER 9/11 happened. That is, until he invaded Iraq for no legitimate reason. When the bookends on your legacy are 9/11 and the Iraq war, sorry m8... you FAILED!"
trump,"I don't disagree. Also let us not forget the financial crisis. But I am trying to give some perspective on what I think the motives of that administration were. It wasn't principally about oil or defense contracts, it was about spreading democracy in a backwards part of the world. It was a bit short sighted perhaps, but it wasn't a terrible idea after the success of the Cold War and in the aftermath of 9/11."
trump,"Lol that is not what their goals were.

Read about neoconservatives and the Project for a New American Century"
trump,I have...and that was precisely what their goal was. Using American military might to spread Democracy and American values around the world...particularly in the Middle East. Perhaps you need to read more about those things and not me? 
trump,"LMAO. The goal of american intervention in the middle east is NOT spreading democracy. It's always been DESTABILIZATION and preservation of the petrodollar. Libya is a great example of this.

I don't know what you read that made you think they want to spread ""good american values"" (just smh at that, makes me want to throw up) but maybe you shouldn't believe everything you read :)"
trump,http://www.vox.com/2016/2/16/11022104/iraq-war-neoconservatives
trump,">decent public servant

We may both love Trump, but I gotta step in here.

H. W. was a goddamn war hero. Seriously, go read about his service flying over the Pacific in WW2 - guy did tremendous things. 

He was a Congressman, ambassador to the UN, and Director of the CIA. Then he was Reagan's #2 for both terms, before picking up a term as President himself. 

He was one of the most exemplary public servants in American history.

And he went skydiving for his 90th birthday. Bad. Ass.

And damn, for me at least, part of my ""Great America"" has a little 1988 in it."
trump,"He seems like he'd be the kid that you would feel guilty for not being friends with.  He is super nice, invites you over, you get to play with his toys, and he even says you can have some of them hoping it will bring you back another time.  You never go back though because of how awkward the entire thing was, it's almost like you sense desperation and a lack of self-respect that puts you off."
trump,"Holy shit, that was the best analogy I've read about this guy. Well done."
trump,"Yeah and George W Bush is that friend you hang out with all the time. Drinking beer, watching movies, and hitting the club with. He would be the one getting all the girls though. This would start to get under your skin after a while. Until he realizes what he was doing and helps you out. That night you go back with two girls under your arm for every four Bush takes back."
trump,"> it's almost like you sense desperation and a lack of self-respect that puts you off.

""Please clap.""

""Oh, looks like they are kicking me off.""

Etc."
trump,"He's the kid who your parents make you go hang out with because ""he's a nice boy!""."
trump,It's like the Simpsons episode where Bart has a play date with Ralph.
trump,I can imagine Jeb reading these comments teary eyed.
trump,I legit think you just summed up Jeb's childhood.
trump,And his adulthood.
trump,Poor guac bowl merchant 
trump,"As far as the environment goes, Jeb would have made a great president. I mean, who knows more about **LOW ENERGY** usage than him?"
trump,Savage 
trump,That was solid.
trump,"I honestly feel a bit sorry for Jeb. He seems like the nice suburban neighbor who hosts great backyard BBQs.

His campaign was like one giant trainwreck: It was horrible, but you couldn't stop looking.

RIP in guac you foolish guac bowl merchant.

trump,Ouch! Poor Jeb(!).
trump,"Not like any of it was his money. And he lost, so none of his donors get any favors either. He's probably going back to making shitty guac and playing with toy turtles like nothing happened, just to put the shame of his absolute stumping behind him as soon as possible."
trump,"Holy shit, this sub is reaching r/all every day now! "
trump,"Guys, I honestly think Jeb is much better than his shitty brother. "
trump,"Guys, the Bush ship has been sunk. I have absolutely LOVED the Bush memes and am estatic that he was driven straight out of this race. But I think we need to move on to better targets. We can be as high energy as we want but we can't be wasteful with that energy. Inefficiency and waste are the opposite of what we are trying to achieve!"

>Hey guys...
With the win, I think we should be expecting an influx of subscribers/visitors... and trolls. Do not feed the trolls. If anything, treat them with positivity and empathy."
kasich,Nothing annoys negative people like positivity.
kasich,"They're circlejerking themselves silly over in /r/The_Donald about Ohio proving itself to be the ""cuckeye"" state, so everybody should be prepared for the hate that's been directed Bush & Rubio to be thrown at us in the coming weeks."
kasich,"Subreddits like that reinforce my love/hate relationship with the internet.  

If you want to make a true subreddit to support Trump, it is your God-given right to do so.  The problem is when it becomes a mockery.  I don't think those people realize that mockery can be interpreted as serious, and can cause true ramifications in the real world.  

It creates a toxic environment for us all.

Edit: Just learned that this is called the ""Poe Effect."""
kasich,"Someone should sticky this. Btw well done guys, support from Europe :)"
kasich,They will be banned promptly I will not tolerate it.
kasich,Maybe consider beefing up the mod team as well to prepare.

kasich,"What does Kasich have in common with Eisenhower and Lincoln?

kasich,"As an ex Ohio resident and unaffiliated moderate I'm very happy about this. I've been sitting on the fence this election and looking for the best candidate to beat Trump. Well, not only that, Kasich really has been the voice of reason and moderation. How can I help?"
kasich,"First step: Buy a hat or tshirt off the website so you can rep him around town. I recommend hat, as you won't need to wash it every single day to rep him. The profits also go to his campaign, so it's good that way too.

Second step: Sign up with a phone bank. 

Step three: Talk to all the Rubio supporters you know and get them in on this.
"
kasich,[deleted]
kasich,Done. And Wisconsin is an open primary so I can participate!
kasich,Awesome! We have a chance there. 
kasich,Proud supporter from Florida checking in!  Sorry my state makes horrible voting choices.

kasich,"Rubio supporter here, after kasichs response and general hate of Rubio I doubt that will happen. I like kasichs policies best compared to the rest so I'll be over here more. 

Cruz gets most of Rubio  supporters I bet. "
kasich,"I was split Rubio / Kasich and was probably going to go whoever had the best chance when my primary rolled around, but to me of all combinations of 4 they seemed most cordial to each other and I think are closest policy wise. Not like these 4 were exactly buddies"

kasich,"Bernie Sanders supporter here. I just want to congratulate you guys on a great win in Ohio. It was comforting to see Ohio say no to fascism.... but as for me? There is no good news. Hillary is the democratic candidate. Still, thanks for the Kasich win in Ohio. It's really comforting to me, it gives me a sliver of hope for the future. He's a good man."
kasich,"Thanks for the kind words. I have a lot of respect for Sen. Sanders' message and what he has done in office, and also for the style of campaign he runs. I'm also happy that Hillary hasn't gotten to just walk right in to the nomination; Bernie surprised her with the amount of traction he was able to get, and will hopefully continue to do so."
kasich,"Missouri and Illinois are still in play for Senator Sanders. I'm hoping good things are still in store for him in those two states.   
   
Thank you for the warm congratulations. God speed. "
kasich,"it looks like good things are actually in store, he is surging in the Midwest states right now and already taken missouri. It turns out the horrible results in the beginning were caused by all 3 states counting the early voting results first."
kasich,"You're welcome over here anytime!

In all seriousness, my condolences to you and your party. "
kasich,"Huge day not only for this campaign but for America. I hope this victory, along with Rubio dropping out, get Kasich's face and name out to more people and sparks some momentum."
kasich,"It's absolutely disgusting the amount of support Trump has compared to Kasich.  Good luck guys, do your best to bring sanity back to the Republican party!"
kasich,"I live in Florida, what can I do to help John win the nomination?"
kasich,"https://www.johnkasich.com/volunteer/

Anything on the site helps, including buying from the store. Get yourself a bumper sticker, sign up for a phone bank, anything to get his name out there. The media will finally be covering John and anything else to spread the word helps. If people don't hear Kasich's message they will never notice the contrast between he and his peers in the Republican race."
